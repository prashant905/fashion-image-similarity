# Fashion Image Similarity and Recommendation System

This project is a **fashion image similarity and recommendation system** built using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system allows for finding visually similar fashion items based on a given query image. The project utilizes a pre-trained convolutional neural network to extract embeddings from fashion images, computes similarity scores between images, and recommends similar items to users. It also includes a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations.

## Project Overview

The Fashion Image Similarity and Recommendation System is designed to:
1. Load a dataset of fashion images and associated metadata.
2. Extract embeddings using a pre-trained neural network model (e.g., ResNet50 or EfficientNet).
3. Compute similarity between images based on their embeddings.
4. Generate and visualize recommendations for similar items.
5. Evaluate the recommendation systemâ€™s accuracy and relevancy based on similarity-driven predictions.

## Features

- **Image Embedding Extraction**: Uses pre-trained CNN models (ResNet50, EfficientNet) to extract feature vectors (embeddings) for fashion images.
- **Similarity Computation**: Calculates cosine similarity scores to measure the visual similarity between images.
- **Recommendation System**: Provides similar fashion items based on a query image.
- **Evaluation Framework**: Includes precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices for assessing recommendation quality.
